If you use any of the comparison operators, the result will be a boolean value (such as the example of <code>hasFever</code> above). Using logical operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> - and, <code>||</code> - or, <code>!</code> - not), you can combine multiple boolean values:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>let isDog = true;\nlet isCat = true;\n\nlet isCanine = isDog &amp;&amp; !isCat;\n</code></pre> <p>It is worth noting that logical expressions are calculated from left to right and that no obviously unnecessary calculations are made. For example:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>let isCanine = isDog &amp;&amp; !isCat;\n</code></pre> <p>For <code>isCanine</code> to get the value of true, <code>isDog</code> has to be true and <code>isCat</code> has to be false. Assuming <code>isDog</code> isn't true, we no longer need to check whether the animal is not a cat. This is known as a short-circuit evaluation.</p> <p>Similarly, when using the logical operator or, <code>||</code>: JavaScript<pre><code>let isCanine = isDog || isWolf;\n</code></pre></p> <p>Here either <code>isDog</code> or <code>isWolf</code> need to be true for <code>isCanine</code> to be true. Therefore, checking from left to right, if <code>isDog</code> is true there is no need to calculate <code>isWolf</code>.</p> <p>Test it out with these functions and try to predict what they will print:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>function t1(){\n    console.log(\"t1\");\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nfunction t2(){\n    console.log(\"t2\");\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nfunction f1(){\n    console.log(\"f1\");\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nfunction f2(){\n    console.log(\"f2\");\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nfunction testBooleans(){\n    console.log(\"Testing booleans!\");\n\n    let b = t1() &amp;&amp; (t2() || f1());\n    console.log(\"Results 1 for b \" + b);\n\n    b = t1() || t2() || f1();\n    console.log(\"Results 2 for b \" + b);\n\n    b = f1() || (t2() &amp;&amp; (f1() || f2()));\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chapter-3-conditionals/#32-boolean-coercion","title":"3.2 Boolean coercion","text":"<p>In JavaScript, we don't always have to use explicit booleans for expressions to be evauluated.

We could write if statements: JavaScript<pre><code>if(fruit === \"Papaya\"){\n    console.log(\"It is a Papaya!\");\n} else if(fruit === \"Orange\"){\n    console.log(\"It is an Orange!\");\n}\n...\n</code></pre></p> <p>But this would take a long time and would be quite repetitive. While the repetition in this case might be hard to avoid, we can employ a different method to better match the fruit against a string and print something specific via the switch statement.</p> <p>The switch statement similarly allows code execution based on conditions. It evaluates an expression, matching the value against a series of case clauses, and executes statements where the case clause has a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. If there is no match, it will use a default clause. </p> <p>This may seem confusing, but observe the example below: JavaScript<pre><code>const fruit = \"Papaya\";\n\nswitch (fruit) {\n\u00a0 case \"Orange\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is an Orange!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n\u00a0 case \"Mango\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is a Mango!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n\u00a0 case \"Papaya\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is a Papaya!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n\u00a0 case \"Durian\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is Durian!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n\u00a0 default:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"What fruit is that?\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Like before, we are trying to match the value of our fruit variable to some fruit name in string format. Here's how it works:</p> <ul> <li>We input the expression we want to compare, in this case the fruit variable and the value <code>\"Papaya\"</code>.</li> <li>The switch statement starts from the first case, <code>\"Orange\"</code> and performs a strict equality comparison <code>===</code></li> <li>As it returns false, the switch statement keeps proceeding downwards, comparing each case expression (in this case fruit strings) against our fruit variable value.</li> <li>Finally, we reach the case <code>\"Papaya\"</code>, which evaluates to true, they are the same. The code below is then executed, printing <code>\"It is a Papaya!\"</code>.</li> <li>Since we don't want the switch statement to continue, we use the break statement to stop it from comparing further (or alternatively a return or continue statement).</li> </ul> <p>Assuming we don't stop it using break, execution will proceed to the next case clause, even to the default clause, regardless of whether that clause's expression matches. This is called fall-through. Try the example below:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>const fruit = \"Papaya\";\n\nswitch (fruit) {\n\u00a0 case \"Orange\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is an Orange!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n\u00a0 case \"Mango\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is a Mango!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n\u00a0 case \"Papaya\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is a Papaya!\");\n\n\u00a0 case \"Durian\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is Durian!\");\n\n\u00a0 default:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"What fruit is that?\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We get three prints, which may not be intended. We can however take advantage of fall-through in case multiple conditions are supposed to result in the same code execution:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>const animal = \"Cow\";\n\nswitch (animal) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Cow\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Pig\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Chicken\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Sheep\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is a farm animal!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0 default:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"Does this animal belong on a farm?\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, any of the farm animal cases result in the same console log, while unhandled cases are handled via the default clause. </p> <p>It is noteworthy that default does not need to be placed last, and may also trigger a fall-through:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>const animal = \"Space Cow\";\n\nswitch (animal) {\n    default:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"Does this animal belong on a farm?\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Cow\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Pig\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Chicken\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 case \"Sheep\":\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 console.log(\"It is a farm animal!\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 break;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For more complex use, for instance when replacing if...else and with intent to use fall-through, one could also employ a <code>switch(true)</code> pattern:</p> JavaScript<pre><code>switch (true) {\n  case isSquare(shape):\n    console.log(\"This shape is a square.\");\n    // Fall-through, since a square is a rectangle as well!\n\n  case isRectangle(shape):\n    console.log(\"This shape is a rectangle.\");\n\n  case isQuadrilateral(shape):\n    console.log(\"This shape is a quadrilateral.\");\n    break;\n\n  case isCircle(shape):\n    console.log(\"This shape is a circle.\");\n    break;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chapter-3-conditionals/#36-tasks-switch","title":"3.6 Tasks (switch)","text":""},{"location":"chapter-3-conditionals/#361-categories-of-food","title":"3.6.1 Categories of food","text":"<p>Convert the following function from using if-else to using switch: JavaScript<pre><code>function getFoodCategory(food){\n    if(food === \"Rice\"){\n        return \"Starch\";\n    } else if(food === \"Apple\"){\n        return \"Fruit\";\n    } else if(food === \"Broccoli\"){\n        return \"Vegetable\";\n    } else if(food === \"Chicken\"){\n        return \"Protein\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Food category unknown\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"chapter-3-conditionals/#362-switch-string-concatenation","title":"3.6.2 switch string concatenation","text":"<p>Remember the if-else string concatenation task using if and if-else statements?
